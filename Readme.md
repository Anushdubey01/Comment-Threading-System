- **Assignment**: Comment Threading System Implementation

## 📋 Problem Statement

A robust **in-memory comment threading system** that supports nested replies up to 5 levels deep, with both tree and flat view capabilities. The system is designed to handle concurrent users adding comments and replies while maintaining data integrity and performance.

## ✨ Features Implemented

### 🎯 Core Requirements ✅
- **Comment Addition**: Users can add comments to posts with user, timestamp, and content
- **Nested Replies**: Support for replies up to 5 levels deep with proper tree structure
- **Tree View**: Hierarchical display of comments with nested replies
- **Flat View**: Chronological list of all comments without nesting
- **In-Memory Storage**: Efficient data structures without persistent database

### 🚀 Advanced Features ✅
- **Auto-Collapse**: Automatically collapses threads with more than 10 replies
- **Voting System**: Upvote/downvote functionality with vote count tracking
- **User Indexing**: Efficient retrieval of all comments by a specific user
- **Thread Safety**: Concurrent access support using proper locking mechanisms
- **Comment Deletion**: Cascade deletion with recursive reply removal
- **Input Validation**: Comprehensive validation for all user inputs
- **Toggle Collapse**: Manual expand/collapse functionality for threads

## 🏗️ System Architecture

### Core Classes

#### **Comment** (`@dataclass`)
```python
@dataclass
class Comment:
    id: int                    # Unique identifier
    user: str                  # Author username
    content: str               # Comment text
    timestamp: float           # Creation time
    parent_comment_id: Optional[int]  # For threading
    replies: List['Comment']   # Child comments
    vote_count: int            # Voting system
    collapsed: bool            # UI state management
```

#### **Post**
```python
class Post:
    def __init__(self, id: int, title: str, comment_system):
        self.id = id
        self.title = title
        self.comment_system = comment_system
        self.comments: List[Comment] = []  # Top-level comments only
```

#### **CommentSystem** (Main Controller)
```python
class CommentSystem:
    def __init__(self):
        self.posts: Dict[int, Post] = {}           # O(1) post lookup
        self.comments: Dict[int, Comment] = {}     # O(1) comment lookup
        self.user_comments: Dict[str, List[int]] = {}  # User indexing
        self.next_comment_id = 1                   # ID generation
        self.next_post_id = 1
        self.lock = threading.Lock()               # Thread safety
```

### 🔧 Key Algorithms

#### **Depth Calculation**
- **Purpose**: Enforces 5-level nesting limit
- **Time Complexity**: O(depth) - linear to nesting level
- **Space Complexity**: O(1) - constant space

#### **Auto-Collapse**
- **Purpose**: UI optimization for long threads
- **Trigger**: Automatically collapses threads with 10+ replies
- **Time Complexity**: O(n) where n = total replies in thread

#### **Thread Safety**
- **Implementation**: Uses `threading.Lock()` for all critical sections
- **Benefits**: Prevents race conditions and data corruption
- **Coverage**: All read/write operations are thread-safe

## 📊 Performance Characteristics

| Operation | Time Complexity | Space Complexity | Description |
|-----------|----------------|------------------|-------------|
| Add Comment | O(1) | O(1) | Constant time addition |
| Get Tree View | O(1) | O(1) | Direct reference return |
| Get Flat View | O(n) | O(n) | Recursive flattening |
| Delete Comment | O(m) | O(1) | m = replies in subtree |
| User Comments | O(k) | O(1) | k = user's comment count |

## 🧪 Testing

### Test Coverage
The system includes comprehensive tests covering:

1. **Basic Operations**: Comment addition and replies
2. **Depth Enforcement**: 5-level nesting limit validation
3. **View Generation**: Tree vs flat view correctness
4. **Voting System**: Upvote/downvote functionality
5. **Auto-Collapse**: Thread collapsing logic
6. **User Indexing**: User comment retrieval
7. **Deletion**: Cascade deletion with cleanup
8. **Input Validation**: Edge case handling

### Example Test Cases
- ✅ Adding comments and replies
- ✅ Maximum depth enforcement (5 levels)
- ✅ Flat view functionality
- ✅ Voting system
- ✅ Auto-collapse behavior
- ✅ User indexing
- ✅ Comment deletion
- ✅ Input validation

## 🚀 Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites
- **Python 3.7+**
- **No external dependencies** - Uses only Python standard library

### Installation
```bash
# Clone or download the project
# No additional setup required
```

#### Demo Mode
```bash
python main.py
```
This will run a demonstration showing:
- Creating posts and comments

- Performance characteristics

## 📝 Usage Examples

### Basic Usage
```python
from comment_system import CommentSystem

# Create system and post
system = CommentSystem()
post = system.create_post("Welcome to our platform!")

# Add comments
comment = system.add_comment(post.id, "Alice", "Great post!")
reply = system.add_comment(post.id, "Bob", "I agree!", comment.id)

# Get views
tree_view = system.get_comments_view(post.id, "tree")
flat_view = system.get_comments_view(post.id, "flat")

# Voting
system.upvote_comment(comment.id)
```

### Advanced Features
```python
# User indexing
user_comments = system.get_user_comments("Alice")

# Toggle collapse
system.toggle_collapse(comment.id)

# Delete comment (cascades to replies)
system.delete_comment(comment.id)
```
